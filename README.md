# CAT-module-SMU
My code for Spreadsheet and Modelling module group project at SMU
Code used: Python 3.7 & VBA
NOTE: The excel file employed the Bloomberg plug-ins provided by my school library. The code will not collect live data unless you have it installed on your computer.

Description: This is a rudimentary trading bot designed by my group, with me as the main programmer. The aim is to simulate the trading of futures and ETF stocks.
With python scripts, I use the BeautifulSoup library to automate daily data scraping from Singapore MSCI futures and STI ETF website.
Using VBA, the live data collected from the Bloomberg Plugin and data scraped at the beginning trading hours of each day are continuously analyzed and calculated, and deciding to enter or exit a position. All of these are recorded on the excel sheet

Total time taken: 3 days(1 day to learn VBA, with the help of Coursera VBA and modelling course), average 5-6 hours each day.
